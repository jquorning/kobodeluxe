# Kobo Deluxe
#### An enhanced port of the scrolling video game XKobo

### DESCRIPTION
       Kobo  Deluxe  is  a  3'rd person scrolling 2D shooter with a simple and
       responsive control system - which you'll need to  tackle  the  tons  of
       enemy  ships  that shoot at you, chase you, circle around you shooting,
       or even launch other ships at you, while you're trying to  destroy  the
       labyrinth shaped bases. There are 50 action packed levels with smoothly
       increasing difficulty,  and  different  combinations  of  enemies  that
       require different tactics to be dealt with successfully.

       Kobo Deluxe has an improved graphics engine that delivers smoother ani-
       mation, while keeping the game logic totally accurate  and  predictable
       regardless  of  frame  rate.  It also adds sound effects, new graphics,
       fullscreen mode, four extra skill levels  with  smoother  gameplay  and
       various  other  features expected from a modern game. (There is still a
       "Clasic" mode that plays exactly like the original XKobo.)

       Kobo Deluxe uses SDL for sound, graphics and input, and builds and runs
       on all major operating systems, as well as some more unusual platforms.
       It can also use OpenGL for accelerated rendering, through glSDL.

       In short, Kobo Deluxe is loads of classical arcade style fun  for  just
       about any machine with graphics and sound!
